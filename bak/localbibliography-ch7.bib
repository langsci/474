The ultimate objective of the project is to expand Princeton WordNet with conceptual frames that define the syntagmatic relations of verb synsets and the semantic classes of nouns felicitous to combine with particular verbs. At this stage of the work: a) over 5,000 WordNet verb synsets have been supplied with manually evaluated FrameNet semantic frames, b) 253 semantic types have been manually mapped to the appropriate WordNet concepts providing detailed ontological representation of the semantic classes of nouns.",

abstract = {Because meaningful sentences are composed of meaningful words, any system that hopes to process natural languages as people do must have information about words and their meanings. This information is traditionally provided through dictionaries, and machine-readable dictionaries are now widely available. But dictionary entries evolved for the convenience of human readers, not for machines. WordNet1 provides a more effective combination of traditional lexicographic information and modern computing. WordNet is an online lexical database designed for use under program control. English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are organized into sets of synonyms, each representing a lexicalized concept. Semantic relations link the synonym sets [4].},

This learning can be realized in practical skills. Capable develop critical thinking and practical skills requires the right learning approach. This requires learning by students to construct their own knowledge, conduct investigations, develop curiosity, learning communities, present models, encourage reflection abilities, and discuss not only cognitive but also skills. Contextual Teaching and Learning is an approach that has a component that requires learning. Research and uncover the ability of CTL in developing critical thinking and practical skills of students. The research method used is the reference study method. The results show that CTL has a component that can encourage the development of critical thinking and practical skills of students.}
