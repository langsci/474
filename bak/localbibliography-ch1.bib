It focuses on reuse of free electronic resources and their role in the acquisition and population of Swedish frames. After a brief overview of Swedish resources, we reflect on three approaches to recycling the available lexical data in a semi-automatic manner. SweFN++ will be a multi-functional resource supporting research within lexicology and linguistics as well as different applications within computational lexicography and language technology, not to mention e-science.},

By comparing the syntactic and semantic affordances of a lexical unit in the source language with those shown by all lexical units evoking the same frame in a target language, the application suggests which of them is the best-fit translation equivalent. The application contributes to the purpose of bringing to scale the development of frame-based multilingual lexical databases. We discuss the current limitations of the application, especially those regarding entity nouns, and propose the use of ontologies and qualia structure as a means of enhancing machine translation for entity nouns.",

An orchestrator process has been developed to control the NLP pipeline performing an end-to-end data processing and annotation starting from the documents identification and ending in the generation of statistical reports. The Bulgarian MARCELL corpus consists of 25,283 documents (at the beginning of November 2019), which are classified into eleven types.",
